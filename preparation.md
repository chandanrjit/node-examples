# Preparation for training

- install node with npm. We'll be using node 11 or 12
- run `npm update -g npm` (with sudo if necessary) to get the latest npm on top of that


```
mkdir node-training-sandbox
cd node-training-sandbox
git clone https://github.com/naugtur/node-examples
cd node-examples
npm install
```
